# FeelingLonelyChatroom


* Typing a message into the text input and hitting enter should create a message in the chatbox.
* The text box should be cleared out when enter is pressed to make room for the next message.
* The message should always be from either "Me", "Myself", or "I".
* The message should be timestamped.
* Clicking an X by the message should delete the message.
* Clicking the "I feel lonely" button should make an API request to the [Internet Chuck Norris Joke Database](http://www.icndb.com/) -- specificially, to the random joke endpoint: https://api.icndb.com/jokes/random.  Hint: you probably want to use [fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch) to do this.
* It should create a new message in the chatbox, from "Fact"
